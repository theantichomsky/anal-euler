# anal-euler

Tool for solving a recursive function v' and then let v'' be a constant velocity vector such that we have some position function s(t), but by superimposing do you mean that s(t + dt) is supposed to be the integrand of v(i) + w? <-- where i is just the time from t to t + dt.

So in other words, s(t+dt) = s(t) + ∫t, t+dt (v(i) + w))di
-> ∫t, t+dt (v(i)+w))di = (v' + w) x dt
-> s(t+dt) = s(t) + (v' + w) x dt
